# Hello! I'm Kim üëã

I‚Äôm a dedicated software developer with a strong focus on both front-end and back-end development. My expertise spans a range of technologies, including cloud computing, where I leverage platforms like AWS and Azure to build scalable and efficient solutions.

My journey into software development followed a fulfilling career in marine conservation and scuba diving. As a technical diver and scuba instructor, I honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail‚Äîqualities that now drive my approach to software engineering. This unique background allows me to approach complex challenges with a distinct perspective and a strong commitment to precision.

On the front end, I specialize in creating intuitive, responsive user interfaces using modern technologies. On the back end, I utilize frameworks like Django to build scalable APIs and services, alongside other technologies such as Node.js and various databases. My experience with cloud platforms enhances my ability to develop and deploy applications that are both high-performing and reliable.

I‚Äôm enthusiastic about exploring new technologies and collaborating with others who share a passion for innovation and excellence in software development. Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre interested in discussing development projects, cloud computing, or the intersection of technology and environmental conservation.
